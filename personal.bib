	note = {An elegant telemetry payload, which transmits IMU, atmospheric, or light data during flight anddeployment from a small model rocket, is presented. Data is received by a custom, mobile, handpointedground station. The payload is patterned after a thumb-sized satellite, called a femtosat. Itsdesign is optimized for ease of implementation. The femtosat system resulted from a grassroots,student peer-mentoring program developed at Brigham Young University.},

	note = {Brigham Young Universityâ€™s first smallsat project, like many university smallsat projects, faced significant personnel challenges. The time required for inexperienced undergraduates to become contributing team members, combined with moderate turnover, caused overruns in the budget and schedule. To find and train future team members for employment, the student team formed a club and instituted a peer-mentored, introductory-level challenge to design, build, and fly a miniature, fully-functional model spacecraft, in one semester. At very low cost, two annual rounds of the challenge provided more than 30 students with full-cycle, design-to-flight engineering experience. Leveraging this introductory experience, many participants have now contributed to more advanced smallsat projects. We describe the low-cost project and implementation of the challenge format along with recommendations for starting similar programs at other schools.},
