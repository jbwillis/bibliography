    abstract = "{Small rotorcraft unmanned air vehicles (sUAVs) are valuable tools in solving geospatial inspection challenges. One area where this is being widely explored is disaster reconnaissance [1]. Using sUAVs to collect images provides engineers and government officials critical information about the conditions before and after a disaster [2]. This is accomplished by creating high- fidelity 3D models from the sUAV’s imagery. However, using an sUAV to perform inspections is a challenging task due to constraints on the vehicle’s flight time, computational power, and data storage capabilities [3]. The approach presented in this article illustrates a method for utilizing multiple sUAVs to inspect a disaster region and merge the separate data into a single high-resolution 3D model.}",

Data is received by a custom, mobile, handpointedground station. The payload is patterned after a thumb-sized satellite, called a femtosat. Itsdesign is optimized for ease of implementation. The femtosat system resulted from a grassroots,student peer-mentoring program developed at Brigham Young University.},

	note = {Brigham Young University’s first smallsat project, like many university smallsat projects, faced significant personnel challenges. The time required for inexperienced undergraduates to become contributing team members, combined with moderate turnover, caused overruns in the budget and schedule. To find and train future team members for employment, the student team formed a club and instituted a peer-mentored, introductory-level challenge to design, build, and fly a miniature, fully-functional model spacecraft, in one semester. At very low cost, two annual rounds of the challenge provided more than 30 students with full-cycle, design-to-flight engineering experience. Leveraging this introductory experience, many participants have now contributed to more advanced smallsat projects. We describe the low-cost project and implementation of the challenge format along with recommendations for starting similar programs at other schools.},
